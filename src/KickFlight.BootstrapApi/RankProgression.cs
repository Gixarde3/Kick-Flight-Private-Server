// Battle rank as a real, persisted quantity.
//
// Rank is not free-form: the client looks its league badge up by rank and the badge set it ships is not
// complete. For the regular rules (battleRuleType 1) BattleUtil.GetDisplayRankPath caps the rank to
// BattleRankMaster.RegularEndRank and switches to badge variant 1, and in retail that variant exists only
// for rank 7. Any rank below 7 therefore asks for a badge that is not in the bundle and the UI breaks, which
// is why the floor here is rank 7 rather than 0 - the same reason the served BattleRank table ends the
// regular flags at rank 7. Above 7 the badge is the S+ ladder, which is complete through rank 16.
//
// Thresholds mirror the BattleRank master served in DemoSessionApi (row id = rank + 1, totalBattlePoint per
// rank): 0, 200, 500, 900, 1400, 1900, 2400, [2900 = rank 7], 3400, 3900, 4400, 4900, 5400, 5900, 6400,
// 6900, 7500. Keep the two in step: the client interpolates the progress bar between them, so a rank that
// disagrees with its own threshold renders a bar past its end.
