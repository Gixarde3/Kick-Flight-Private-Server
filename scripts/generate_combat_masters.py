"""
generate_combat_masters.py

Creates the combat master tables the client needs for basic attacks, discs, kicker
skills and special skills to run without NullReferenceExceptions, and fixes the
skill-id linkage so disc skills resolve against the ActionMaster that ships inside
the APK (actioneditor/aed_master.unity3d: disc skills 10001-10138, kicker skills 20001-20014).

Everything written here is a structurally valid *template*: ids and keys are right,
the tuning numbers are neutral defaults. Edit the JSON files under config/ to fill in
the real effects (see docs/COMBAT_MASTERS_FILL_IN.md for the meaning of every column).

Existing files are never overwritten unless --force is given; masters_skill.json and
masters_disc.json are rewritten in place (id remap only) and a .bak copy is kept.
